consistently higher margins of error. The data was particularly unreliable for Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, in some cases exceeding 100% margins of error. This is likely due to small population sizes within certain counties, which makes estimates less certain. For income levels, counties in southern Virginia showed lower confidence in their margins of error, and these counties also tended to have lower household incomes. By contrast, counties with larger population sizes generally had higher reliability, both in household income estimates and demographic data.\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nAcross all analyses, there were a few systematic patterns that emerges in the reliability of demographic and socioeconomic data. Household income data showed lower confidence concentrated in southern Virginia counties that also exhibited lower household incomes. Demographic data consistently revealed higher margins of error, particularly for Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, in some cases exceeding 100% across all counties. Counties with larger population sizes tended to have more reliable estimates across both demographic and income indicators, highlighting a structural imbalance in data quality.\n\nFrom an equity perspective, these disparities mean that communities of Black and Hispanic/Latino residents face a greater risk of algorithmic bias when data is used for policy, funding, or service allocation. When data carries high uncertainty, any algorithm built on it risks incorrectly representing those groups. Similarly, lower-income communities in southern Virginia also face heightened risk, as unreliable income data undermines equitable targeting of economic support or development programs.\n\nThe root causes of these issues stem primarily from small sample sizes in survey-based data collection methods, which reduce reliability for smaller populations. Smaller minority populations, rural communities, and low-income counties are more likely to experience data quality issues and more dependent on accurate representation for equitable policy outcomes. These factors create a feedback loop where communities most in need of resources have the weakest statistical representation.\n\nTo address these systemic challenges, the Department should invest in data collection for small populations by increasing the percentage per county population data collected. The Department could also look at different data collection surveys in order decrease margin of error. These options could help the Department mitigate risks of algorithmic bias while ensuring that vulnerable communities are not disadvantaged by unreliable data. If they are unable to make these changes, I would urge them to include their margins of error when using any information from the data sets. \n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\ncounty_reliability_table <- county_reliability %>%\n  select(\n    \"County\" = NAME,\n    \"Median Income\" = median_household_incomeE,\n    \"MOE (%)\" = hh_income_moe_pct,\n    \"Reliability\" = hh_income_moe_cat\n  )\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# -

These counties are considered “safe” because the data is statistically sound, enabling reliable automated decision-making with minimal risk of error or bias.\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** \nAlleghany, Amherst, Botetourt, Brunswick, Buchanan, Campbell, Caroline, Carroll, Charles City, Dickenson, Dinwiddie, Fauquier, Fluvanna, Franklin, Giles, Gloucester, Goochland, Greene, Halifax, Henry, King George, Lancaster, Louisa, Madison, Mecklenburg, Middlesex, Montgomery, New Kent, Orange, Page, Pittsylvania, Prince Edward, Prince George, Pulaski, Rockbridge, Russell, Scott, Shenandoah, Smyth, Tazewell, Warren, Wise, Wythe, Bristol, Charlottesville, Colonial Heights, Danville, Fairfax, Falls Church, Franklin, Fredericksburg, Manassas, Martinsville, Petersburg, Poquoson, Salem, Staunton, Waynesboro, Williamsburg, Winchester.\n\nModerate confidence county data should be used cautiously. The data is generally usable but carries enough uncertainty that algorithmic decisions could occasionally be misleading. Though these counties do not need to be manually reviewed every time, it is important to monitor any abnormalities in the data. \n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** \nAccomack, Amelia, Appomattox, Bath, Buckingham, Charlotte, Clarke, Craig, Cumberland, Essex, Floyd, Grayson, Greensville, Highland, King and Queen, King William, Lee, Lunenburg, Mathews, Nelson, Northampton, Northumberland, Nottoway, Patrick, Rappahannock, Richmond, Southampton, Surry, Sussex, Westmoreland, Buena Vista, Covington, Emporia, Galax, Hopewell, Lexington, Manassas Park, Norton, Radford. \n\nThese counties have a high margin of error meaning their data has higher variability with lower data points. This means that decisions that are made using this data set should be checked manually before implementation. \n\n\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n1. Are there regional clusters of counties with consistently high margins of error, and how do these clusters relate to population size, demographics, rurality, or economic conditions?\n2. How do margins of error and confidence levels change over time? \n3. Do certain demographic characteristics such as race and age contribute to higher MOE or lower confidence in algorithmic outputs?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 09/28/2025\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 2025.05.1+513 (2025.05.1+513)\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-jenniferluu6/\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nIn processing the data, I selected Virginia as the focus of analysis. During cleaning, I had to make adjustments to county names by removing the word “City” in certain cases to ensure consistency across data sets. This additional step suggests that similar cleaning may be required if applying the same methods to other states. For county selection, I chose locations I was already familiar with, which provided helpful context for interpreting the results. However, this choice may limit reproducibility since another researcher might select different counties and arrive at slightly different insights.\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe sample size issues affected the reliability of estimates, particularly for smaller demographic groups such as Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, where margins of error sometimes exceeded 100%. Also, county selection was influenced by personal familiarity, which, while helpful for interpretation, may introduce bias and reduce reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
