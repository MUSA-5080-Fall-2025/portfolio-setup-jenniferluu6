    "text": "My name is Jennifer Luu, but I go by Jun (pronounced like June)! I am discovering my path of blending my lived experience and background in construction engineering with urban spatial analytics.\nI think the most effective way to tell you my story is by going through the cities I’ve lived and learned in. If you see a city you’re thinking about visiting, let me know! I would love to share recommendations or even help you plan your trip!\n\nMy Journey\nLeesburg, VA\nI grew up 1-1.5h outside of Washington D.C. It was in this politics-centered city where my flame of affordable housing ignited.\nBlacksburg, VA\nMy interest in working in affordable housing led me to Virginia Tech, where I majored in Construction Engineering and Management. GO HOKIES!\nChicago, IL\nI wanted to integrate myself into a city that with a strong history of housing reform and policy. It was here that I started to think about how my work in different construction projects were affecting the community that I was in. I began a personal research project in an attempt to quantify these effects.\nLos Angeles, CA\nDuring my time in LA, my research interests both expanded and deepened. I was able to see how housing directly affected healthcare and education.\nNew York City, NY\nI had the amazing opportunity to work on my dream project- the thing that I had worked for all through undergrad: renovation of low-income housing in East Brooklyn. I could go on about this, but I will spare you the reading. (Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about it!)\nPhiladelphia, PA\nIt all led to right here, The University of Pennsylvania. Though I loved working in affordable housing construction and it felt like that was what I was running towards since I was 16, I realized something else that I wanted. It is extremely important to do the work in the field, but I wanted to do research to support future projects.\nThanks for reading! I hope you’ll follow me to see where I go next! Maybe it’ll be another city, but maybe I’ll stay right here in Philly."
