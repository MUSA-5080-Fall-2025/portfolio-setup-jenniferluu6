The data was particularly unreliable for Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, in some cases exceeding 100% margins of error. This is likely due to small population sizes within certain counties, which makes estimates less certain. For income levels, counties in southern Virginia showed lower confidence in their margins of error, and these counties also tended to have lower household incomes. By contrast, counties with larger population sizes generally had higher reliability, both in household income estimates and demographic data."

    "text": "5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\nYour Task: Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\nExecutive Summary Requirements: 1. Overall Pattern Identification: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses? 2. Equity Assessment: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings? 3. Root Cause Analysis: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk? 4. Strategic Recommendations: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\nExecutive Summary:\nAcross all analyses, there were a few systematic patterns that emerges in the reliability of demographic and socioeconomic data. Household income data showed lower confidence concentrated in southern Virginia counties that also exhibited lower household incomes. Demographic data consistently revealed higher margins of error, particularly for Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, in some cases exceeding 100% across all counties. Counties with larger population sizes tended to have more reliable estimates across both demographic and income indicators, highlighting a structural imbalance in data quality.\nFrom an equity perspective, these disparities mean that communities of Black and Hispanic/Latino residents face a greater risk of algorithmic bias when data is used for policy, funding, or service allocation. When data carries high uncertainty, any algorithm built on it risks incorrectly representing those groups. Similarly, lower-income communities in southern Virginia also face heightened risk, as unreliable income data undermines equitable targeting of economic support or development programs.\nThe root causes of these issues stem primarily from small sample sizes in survey-based data collection methods, which reduce reliability for smaller populations. Smaller minority populations, rural communities, and low-income counties are more likely to experience data quality issues and more dependent on accurate representation for equitable policy outcomes. These factors create a feedback loop where communities most in need of resources have the weakest statistical representation.\nTo address these systemic challenges, the Department should invest in data collection for small populations by increasing the percentage per county population data collected. The Department could also look at different data collection surveys in order decrease margin of error. These options could help the Department mitigate risks of algorithmic bias while ensuring that vulnerable communities are not disadvantaged by unreliable data. If they are unable to make these changes, I would urge them to include their margins of error when using any information from the data sets."

These counties are considered “safe” because the data is statistically sound, enabling reliable automated decision-making with minimal risk of error or bias.\n\nCounties requiring additional oversight: Alleghany, Amherst, Botetourt, Brunswick, Buchanan, Campbell, Caroline, Carroll, Charles City, Dickenson, Dinwiddie, Fauquier, Fluvanna, Franklin, Giles, Gloucester, Goochland, Greene, Halifax, Henry, King George, Lancaster, Louisa, Madison, Mecklenburg, Middlesex, Montgomery, New Kent, Orange, Page, Pittsylvania, Prince Edward, Prince George, Pulaski, Rockbridge, Russell, Scott, Shenandoah, Smyth, Tazewell, Warren, Wise, Wythe, Bristol, Charlottesville, Colonial Heights, Danville, Fairfax, Falls Church, Franklin, Fredericksburg, Manassas, Martinsville, Petersburg, Poquoson, Salem, Staunton, Waynesboro, Williamsburg, Winchester.\n\nModerate confidence county data should be used cautiously. The data is generally usable but carries enough uncertainty that algorithmic decisions could occasionally be misleading. Though these counties do not need to be manually reviewed every time, it is important to monitor any abnormalities in the data.\n\nCounties needing alternative approaches: Accomack, Amelia, Appomattox, Bath, Buckingham, Charlotte, Clarke, Craig, Cumberland, Essex, Floyd, Grayson, Greensville, Highland, King and Queen, King William, Lee, Lunenburg, Mathews, Nelson, Northampton, Northumberland, Nottoway, Patrick, Rappahannock, Richmond, Southampton, Surry, Sussex, Westmoreland, Buena Vista, Covington, Emporia, Galax, Hopewell, Lexington, Manassas Park, Norton, Radford.\n\nThese counties have a high margin of error meaning their data has higher variability with lower data points. This means that decisions that are made using this data set should be checked manually before implementation."

    "text": "My name is Jennifer Luu, but I go by Jun (pronounced like June)! I am discovering my path of blending my lived experience and background in construction engineering with urban spatial analytics.\nI think the most effective way to tell you my story is by going through the cities I’ve lived and learned in. If you see a city you’re thinking about visiting, let me know! I would love to share recommendations or even help you plan your trip!\n\nMy Journey\nLeesburg, VA\nI grew up 1-1.5h outside of Washington D.C. It was in this politics-centered city where my flame of affordable housing ignited.\nBlacksburg, VA\nMy interest in working in affordable housing led me to Virginia Tech, where I majored in Construction Engineering and Management. GO HOKIES!\nChicago, IL\nI wanted to integrate myself into a city that with a strong history of housing reform and policy. It was here that I started to think about how my work in different construction projects were affecting the community that I was in. I began a personal research project in an attempt to quantify these effects.\nLos Angeles, CA\nDuring my time in LA, my research interests both expanded and deepened. I was able to see how housing directly affected healthcare and education.\nNew York City, NY\nI had the amazing opportunity to work on my dream project- the thing that I had worked for all through undergrad: renovation of low-income housing in East Brooklyn. I could go on about this, but I will spare you the reading. (Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about it!)\nPhiladelphia, PA\nIt all led to right here, The University of Pennsylvania. Though I loved working in affordable housing construction and it felt like that was what I was running towards since I was 16, I realized something else that I wanted. It is extremely important to do the work in the field, but I wanted to do research to support future projects.\nThanks for reading! I hope you’ll follow me to see where I go next! Maybe it’ll be another city, but maybe I’ll stay right here in Philly."
