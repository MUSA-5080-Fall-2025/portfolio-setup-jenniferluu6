    "text": "My name is Jennifer Luu, but I go by Jun (pronounced like June)! I am discovering my path of blending my lived experience and background in construction engineering with urban spatial analytics.\nI think the most effective way to tell you my story is by going through the cities I’ve lived and learned in. If you see a city you’re thinking about visiting, let me know! I would love to share recommendations or even help you plan your trip!\n\nMy Journey\nLeesburg, VA\nI grew up 1-1.5h outside of Washington D.C. It was in this politics-centered city where my flame of affordable housing ignited.\nBlacksburg, VA\nMy interest in working in affordable housing led me to Virginia Tech, where I majored in Construction Engineering and Management. GO HOKIES!\nChicago, IL\nI wanted to integrate myself into a city that with a strong history of housing reform and policy. It was here that I started to think about how my work in different construction projects were affecting the community that I was in. I began a personal research project in an attempt to quantify these effects.\nLos Angeles, CA\nDuring my time in LA, my research interests both expanded and deepened. I was able to see how housing directly affected healthcare and education.\nNew York City, NY\nI had the amazing opportunity to work on my dream project- the thing that I had worked for all through undergrad: renovation of low-income housing in East Brooklyn. I could go on about this, but I will spare you the reading. (Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about it!)\nPhiladelphia, PA\nIt all led to right here, The University of Pennsylvania. Though I loved working in affordable housing construction and it felt like that was what I was running towards since I was 16, I realized something else that I wanted. It is extremely important to do the work in the field, but I wanted to do research to support future projects.\nThanks for reading! I hope you’ll follow me to see where I go next! Maybe it’ll be another city, but maybe I’ll stay right here in Philly."

The data was particularly unreliable for Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, in some cases exceeding 100% margins of error. This is likely due to small population sizes within certain counties, which makes estimates less certain. For income levels, counties in southern Virginia showed lower confidence in their margins of error, and these counties also tended to have lower household incomes. By contrast, counties with larger population sizes generally had higher reliability, both in household income estimates and demographic data."

Strategic Recommendations: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\nExecutive Summary:\nAcross all analyses, there were a few systematic patterns that emerges in the reliability of demographic and socioeconomic data. Household income data showed lower confidence concentrated in southern Virginia counties that also exhibited lower household incomes. Demographic data consistently revealed higher margins of error, particularly for Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, in some cases exceeding 100% across all counties. Counties with larger population sizes tended to have more reliable estimates across both demographic and income indicators, highlighting a structural imbalance in data quality.\nFrom an equity perspective, these disparities mean that communities of Black and Hispanic/Latino residents face a greater risk of algorithmic bias when data is used for policy, funding, or service allocation. When data carries high uncertainty, any algorithm built on it risks incorrectly representing those groups. Similarly, lower-income communities in southern Virginia also face heightened risk, as unreliable income data undermines equitable targeting of economic support or development programs.\nThe root causes of these issues stem primarily from small sample sizes in survey-based data collection methods, which reduce reliability for smaller populations. Smaller minority populations, rural communities, and low-income counties are more likely to experience data quality issues and more dependent on accurate representation for equitable policy outcomes. These factors create a feedback loop where communities most in need of resources have the weakest statistical representation.\nTo address these systemic challenges, the Department should invest in data collection for small populations by increasing the percentage per county population data collected. The Department could also look at different data collection surveys in order decrease margin of error. These options could help the Department mitigate risks of algorithmic bias while ensuring that vulnerable communities are not disadvantaged by unreliable data. If they are unable to make these changes, I would urge them to include their margins of error when using any information from the data sets."

These counties are considered “safe” because the data is statistically sound, enabling reliable automated decision-making with minimal risk of error or bias.\n\nCounties requiring additional oversight: Alleghany, Amherst, Botetourt, Brunswick, Buchanan, Campbell, Caroline, Carroll, Charles City, Dickenson, Dinwiddie, Fauquier, Fluvanna, Franklin, Giles, Gloucester, Goochland, Greene, Halifax, Henry, King George, Lancaster, Louisa, Madison, Mecklenburg, Middlesex, Montgomery, New Kent, Orange, Page, Pittsylvania, Prince Edward, Prince George, Pulaski, Rockbridge, Russell, Scott, Shenandoah, Smyth, Tazewell, Warren, Wise, Wythe, Bristol, Charlottesville, Colonial Heights, Danville, Fairfax, Falls Church, Franklin, Fredericksburg, Manassas, Martinsville, Petersburg, Poquoson, Salem, Staunton, Waynesboro, Williamsburg, Winchester.\n\nModerate confidence county data should be used cautiously. The data is generally usable but carries enough uncertainty that algorithmic decisions could occasionally be misleading. Though these counties do not need to be manually reviewed every time, it is important to monitor any abnormalities in the data.\n\nCounties needing alternative approaches: Accomack, Amelia, Appomattox, Bath, Buckingham, Charlotte, Clarke, Craig, Cumberland, Essex, Floyd, Grayson, Greensville, Highland, King and Queen, King William, Lee, Lunenburg, Mathews, Nelson, Northampton, Northumberland, Nottoway, Patrick, Rappahannock, Richmond, Southampton, Surry, Sussex, Westmoreland, Buena Vista, Covington, Emporia, Galax, Hopewell, Lexington, Manassas Park, Norton, Radford.\n\nThese counties have a high margin of error meaning their data has higher variability with lower data points. This means that decisions that are made using this data set should be checked manually before implementation."

This analysis should include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS of your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long or geodetic coordinate systems). The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question\n\n\nEducation & Youth Services\nOption A: Educational Desert Analysis - Data: Schools, Libraries, Recreation Centers, Census tracts (child population) - Question: “Which neighborhoods lack adequate educational infrastructure for children?” - Operations: Buffer schools/libraries (0.5 mile walking distance), identify coverage gaps, overlay with child population density - Policy relevance: School district planning, library placement, after-school program siting\nOption B: School Safety Zones - Data: Schools, Crime Incidents, Bike Network - Question: “Are school zones safe for walking/biking, or are they crime hotspots?” - Operations: Buffer schools (1000ft safety zone), spatial join with crime incidents, assess bike infrastructure coverage - Policy relevance: Safe Routes to School programs, crossing guard placement\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Justice\nOption C: Green Space Equity - Data: Parks, Street Trees, Census tracts (race/income demographics) - Question: “Do low-income and minority neighborhoods have equitable access to green space?” - Operations: Buffer parks (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate tree canopy or park acreage per capita, compare by demographics - Policy relevance: Climate resilience, environmental justice, urban forestry investment —\n\n\nPublic Safety & Justice\nOption D: Crime & Community Resources - Data: Crime Incidents, Recreation Centers, Libraries, Street Lights - Question: “Are high-crime areas underserved by community resources?” - Operations: Aggregate crime counts to census tracts or neighborhoods, count community resources per area, spatial correlation analysis - Policy relevance: Community investment, violence prevention strategies —\n\n\nInfrastructure & Services\nOption E: Polling Place Accessibility - Data: Polling Places, SEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates) - Question: “Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled voters?” - Operations: Buffer polling places and transit stops, identify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access - Policy relevance: Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance\n\n\n\nHealth & Wellness\nOption F: Recreation & Population Health - Data: Recreation Centers, Playgrounds, Parks, Census tracts (demographics) - Question: “Is lack of recreation access associated with vulnerable populations?” - Operations: Calculate recreation facilities per capita by neighborhood, buffer facilities for walking access, overlay with demographic indicators - Policy relevance: Public health investment, recreation programming, obesity prevention\n\n\n\nEmergency Services\nOption G: EMS Response Coverage - Data: Fire Stations, EMS stations, Population density, High-rise buildings - Question: “Are population-dense areas adequately covered by emergency services?” - Operations: Create service area buffers (5-minute drive = ~2 miles), assess population coverage, identify gaps in high-density areas - Policy relevance: Emergency preparedness, station siting decisions\n\n\n\nArts & Culture\nOption H: Cultural Asset Distribution - Data: Public Art, Museums, Historic sites/markers, Neighborhoods - Question: “Do all neighborhoods have equitable access to cultural amenities?” - Operations: Count cultural assets per neighborhood, normalize by population, compare distribution across demographic groups - Policy relevance: Cultural equity, tourism, quality of life, neighborhood identity\n\n\n\n\nData Sources\nOpenDataPhilly: https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/ - Most datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates - Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\nAdditional Sources: - Pennsylvania Open Data: https://data.pa.gov/ - Census Bureau (via tidycensus): Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns - TIGER/Line (via tigris): Geographic boundaries\n\n\nRecommended Starting Points\nIf you’re feeling confident: Choose an advanced challenge with multiple data layers.

Just make sure: - You can access the spatial data - You can perform at least 2 spatial operations\n\n\nYour Analysis\nYour Task:\n\nFind and load additional data\n\nDocument your data source\nCheck and standardize the CRS\nProvide basic summary statistics\n\n\n\n# Load your additional dataset\nrecreation_centers &lt;- st_read(\"https://opendata.arcgis.com/api/v3/datasets/9eb26a787a6e448ba426eea7f9f0d93a_0/downloads/data?format=geojson&spatialRefId=4326\")\n\nReading layer `PPR_Program_Sites' from data source \n  `https://opendata.arcgis.com/api/v3/datasets/9eb26a787a6e448ba426eea7f9f0d93a_0/downloads/data?format=geojson&spatialRefId=4326' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 171 features and 10 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -75.2563 ymin: 39.90444 xmax: -74.96944 ymax: 40.12284\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n#check crs\nst_crs(pa_centroids)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:3365 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"NAD83(HARN) / Pennsylvania South (ftUS)\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"NAD83(HARN)\",\n        DATUM[\"NAD83 (High Accuracy Reference Network)\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"GRS 1980\",6378137,298.257222101,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        ID[\"EPSG\",4152]],\n    CONVERSION[\"SPCS83 Pennsylvania South zone (US survey foot)\",\n        METHOD[\"Lambert Conic Conformal (2SP)\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of false origin\",39.3333333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8821]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of false origin\",-77.75,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8822]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of 1st standard parallel\",40.9666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8823]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of 2nd standard parallel\",39.9333333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8824]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Easting at false origin\",1968500,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"US survey foot\",0.304800609601219],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8826]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Northing at false origin\",0,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"US survey foot\",0.304800609601219],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8827]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"easting (X)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"US survey foot\",0.304800609601219]],\n        AXIS[\"northing (Y)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"US survey foot\",0.304800609601219]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Engineering survey, topographic mapping.\"],\n        AREA[\"United States (USA) - Pennsylvania - counties of Adams;

It is in WGS 84 and I did need to transform it.\n\n\nPose a research question\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.”Is lack of recreation access associated with vulnerable populations?”\nExamples: - “Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit access to hospitals?” - “Are EMS stations appropriately located near vulnerable populations?” - “Do areas with low vehicle access have worse hospital access?”\n\n\nConduct spatial analysis\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\nRequired operations (choose 2+): - Buffers - Spatial joins - Spatial filtering with predicates - Distance calculations - Intersections or unions - Point-in-polygon aggregation\nYour Task:\n\n# Your spatial analysis\nrec_buffer &lt;- st_buffer(recreation_centers, dist = 2640) #.5 miles\n#centroids of recreation centers\nphila_centroids &lt;- phila_centroids %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    within_recreation_buffer = lengths(st_intersects(geometry, rec_buffer)) &gt; 0\n  )\n#seeing results for both vulnerable and not vulnerable \nrec_summary &lt;- phila_centroids %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_tracts = n(),\n    tracts_with_access = sum(within_recreation_buffer, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_vulnerable_tracts = sum(vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE),\n    vulnerable_with_access = sum(vulnerable & within_recreation_buffer, na.rm = TRUE),\n    vulnerable_without_access = sum(vulnerable & !within_recreation_buffer, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_vulnerable_with_access = round(vulnerable_with_access / total_vulnerable_tracts * 100, 1)\n  )\n\nrec_summary\n\n  total_tracts tracts_with_access total_vulnerable_tracts\n1          408                390                       2\n  vulnerable_with_access vulnerable_without_access pct_vulnerable_with_access\n1                      1                         1                         50\n\n\n\n#to see vulnerable on ggplot\nphila_centroids &lt;- phila_centroids %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    vul_access_cat = case_when(\n      !vulnerable ~ \"Not vulnerable\",\n      vulnerable & within_recreation_buffer ~ \"Vulnerable w/ access\",\n      vulnerable & !within_recreation_buffer ~ \"Vulnerable w/o access\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\nggplot() +\n  # Plot tracts colored by vulnerability + access category\n  geom_sf(\n    data = phila_centroids,\n    aes(fill = vul_access_cat),\n    color = \"white\",\n    size = 0.1\n  ) +\n  \n  # Recreation center buffer used\n  geom_sf(\n    data = rec_buffer,\n    fill = \"blue\",\n    alpha = 0.2,\n    color = NA\n  ) +\n  \n  # Recreation centers\n  geom_sf(\n    data = recreation_centers,\n    color = \"blue\",\n    size = 1,\n    shape = 21,\n    fill = \"white\",\n    stroke = 0.6\n  ) +\n  \n  # County boundary outline\n  geom_sf(\n    data = st_union(phila_centroids),\n    fill = NA,\n    color = \"gray\",\n    linewidth = 0.6\n  ) +\n  \n  # colors for each category\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Not vulnerable\" = \"gray\",\n      \"Vulnerable w/o access\" = \"red\",\n      \"Vulnerable w/ access\" = \"green\"\n    ),\n    name = \"Tract Category\"\n  ) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Recreation Access for Vulnerable Populations in Philadelphia\",\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 11),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis requirements: - Clear code comments explaining each step - Appropriate CRS transformations - Summary statistics or counts - At least one map showing your findings - Brief interpretation of results (3-5 sentences)\nYour interpretation:\nI hadn’t taken a look at the vulnerable tracts in Philadelphia specifically until part 3, which was interesting. There were a lot less vulnerable tracts in Philadelphia than I had originally assumed. Reviewing the recreation center locations, there are no centers in the vulnerable tracts. This could be due to lack of funding in these vulnerable tracts."
