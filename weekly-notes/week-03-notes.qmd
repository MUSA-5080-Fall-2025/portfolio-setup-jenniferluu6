## Key Concepts Learned

Anscombe's Quartet and the limits of summary statistics

\- Depending on the way information is visualized, it can show
completely different patterns.

\- "How to lie with stats/maps"

\- Outliers may represent important communities

\- Relationships aren't always linear

Exploratory Data Analysis is detective work

**Data** → **Aesthetics** → **Geometries** → **Visual**

\- **Data:** Your data set (census data, survey responses, etc.)

\- **Aesthetics:** What variables map to visual properties (x, y, color,
size)

\- **Geometries:** How to display the data (points, bars, lines)

\- **Additional layers:** Scales, themes, facets, annotations

## Coding Techniques

`ggplot(data = your_data) +   aes(x = variable1, y = variable2) +   geom_something() +   additional_layers()`

**Aesthetics map data to visual properties:**

-   `x`, `y` - position

-   `color` - point/line color

-   `fill` - area fill color

-   `size` - point/line size

-   `shape` - point shape

-   `alpha` - transparency

-   `left_join()` - Keep all rows from left dataset

-   `right_join()` - Keep all rows from right dataset

-   `inner_join()` - Keep only rows that match in both

-   `full_join()` - Keep all rows from both datasets

**Important:** Aesthetics go inside `aes()`, constants go outside

## Questions & Challenges

**Pattern:** Smaller populations have higher uncertainty

**Ethical implication:** These communities might be systematically under
counted\

1.  **Report the corresponding MOEs of ACS estimates** - Always include
    margin of error values
2.  **Include a footnote when not reporting MOEs** - Explicitly
    acknowledge omission\
3.  **Provide context for (un)reliability** - Use coefficient of
    variation (CV):
    -   CV \< 12% = reliable (green coding)
    -   CV 12-40% = somewhat reliable (yellow)
    -   CV \> 40% = unreliable (red coding)
4.  **Reduce statistical uncertainty** - Collapse data detail, aggregate
    geographies, use multi-year estimates
5.  **Always conduct statistical significance tests** when comparing ACS
    estimates over time

## Connections to Policy

**Research finding:** Only **27% of planners** warn users about
unreliable ACS data

\- Most planners don't report margins of error

\- Many lack training on statistical uncertainty

**Common problems in government data presentation:**

\- Misleading scales or axes

\- Cherry-picked time periods

\- **Hidden or ignored uncertainty**

\- Missing context about data reliability

## Reflection
Reminder to study through definitions more closely.
